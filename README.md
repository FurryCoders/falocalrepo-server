Web interface for [falocalrepo](https://pypi.org/project/falocalrepo/).

## Installation & Requirements

To install the program it is sufficient to use Python pip and get the package `falocalrepo-server`.

```shell
python3 -m pip install falocalrepo-server
```

Python 3.8 or above is needed to run this program, all other dependencies are handled by pip during installation. For information on how to install Python on your computer, refer to the official website [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

For the program to run, a properly formatted database created by falocalrepo needs to be present in the same folder.

## Usage

```
falocalrepo-server <database> [<host>:<port>]
```

The server needs one argument pointing at the location of a valid [falocalrepo](https://pypi.org/project/falocalrepo/) database and accepts an optional argument to manually set host and port. By default, the server is run on 0.0.0.0:8080.

Once the server is running - it will display status messages in the terminal - the web app can be accessed at http://0.0.0.0:8080/, or any manually set host/port combination.

_Note:_ All the following paths are meant as paths from `<host>:<port>`.

The root folder `/` displays basic information on the database and has links to perform submissions and journal searches.

### Users

The `/user/<username>` path displays basic statistics of a user stored in the database. Clicking on gallery/scraps or journals counters opens submissions and journals by the user respectively.

The `/submissions/<username>` and `/journals/<username>` paths open submissions and journals by the user respectively.

### Search

The server search interface allows to search submissions, journals, and users. Respectively, these can be reached at `/search/submissions`, `/search/journals`, and `/search/users`. The `/search/` path defaults to submissions search.

The interface supports searching all columns of the three tables. In addition to those, the `Any` option will match to any field, and the advanced `SQL` option allows to use SQLite [`WHERE`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html#whereclause) queries.

To add a field, click on the `Add Field`, then select the search field in the drop-down menu beside the newly created input box.

Fields can be added multiple times and will act as OR options. The `SQL` option will override other fields.

Fields are matched using the SQLite [`like`](https://sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#like) expression which allows for limited pattern matching. See [`database` command](https://gitlab.com/MatteoCampinoti94/FALocalRepo#database) for more details.

The `Sort By` and `Order` selections allow to sort and order results using any field.

The `View` option allows to switch from a list view to a grid view of the search results. The view selector and grid view are only supported for submission searches, all others will default to the list view.

The `/submissions/<username>/`, `/gallery/<username>/`, `/scraps/<username>/`, `/favorites/<username>/`, `/mentions/<username>/`, and `/journals/<username>/` paths allow to quickly open a search for submissions, favorites,  and journals associated to `<username>`. `/search/submissions/<username>/`, `/search/gallery/<username>/`, etc. are valid aliases.

### Browse

The `/browse/submissions`, `/browse/journals`, and `/browse/users` paths allow to open a list of all entries in a specific table. From there the results can be refined using the search interface. 

### Submissions & Journals

Submissions and journals can be accessed respectively at `/submission/<id>` and `/journal/<id>`. All the metadata, content and files that are recorded in the database are displayed in these pages.

Submission files can be accessed at `/submission/<id>/file` or by using the `Download File` or `Download Submission as ZIP` buttons.

For both submissions and journals it is possible to download a ZIP containing the metadata in a JSON-formatted file and the submission description/journal content in HTML format. For submissions, the ZIP file also contains the submission file. The ZIP of a submission/journal can be accessed directly using the `/submission/<id>/zip` and `/journal/<id>/zip` paths.
